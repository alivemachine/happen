# happen
 
Is a light weight generative self-programming self-operating system in development. 
The principle is based on single cell type elements containing data as well as how to read the data. Typically in a browser environment each cell contains enough HTML (structure) CSS (composition) and JS (behavior) to operate by themselves without global dependency and can be added and modified to any other web page. Interacting is editing is rendering. Everything happens at every level and each cell reveals its content change as directly as possible. Each cell is then a model (prompt) for Open AI's Codex or Codegen to generated more cells based on instructions or without any. The intention of this platform is to start with the smallest possible amount of code encapsulated as structural, compositional and behavioral units that make an extremely modular hyper object web that can lead to a wide variety of experiences.
The cells are also made to be visual, audio, material, haptic... units in order to be interacted with the same logic throughout the entire Maslo Ambient Operating System.

Run:
- https://alivemachine.io/happen/
- click "style.css"
- click "string2img.js"
- click "apiKeyInput.js"
- click "looper.js" to generate new functions

To Do:
- cell versionning (access previous versions of each cells with github api)
- save new cells with github api
- visualize cells evolution by deploying them accross rows or columns in order to visualize their roots and branchings.
